This project consists of the very first steps of a port of Clojure to
Python.  At the moment it is interpreted and does very little (see
file test_lisp.py for examples).

It was inspired in part by my recent fascination with Clojure, my
long-standing love of Python, and a recent compiler class[1] I took.
It may or may not actually go anywhere, or wind up being faithful to
the existing Clojure language family (Clojure on the JVM,
ClojureScript, clojure-clr, ...).  Mostly it's just to see how far I
can take it.  I probably shouldn't even call it PyClojure, but the
name serves to indicate my intentions....
