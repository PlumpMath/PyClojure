Unit testing can be done by typing 'nosetests'.  You'll need to install
nose first (e.g. 'pip install nose').

I'm striving for 100% test coverage.  Please add test cases for any
new contributions whenever possible.  Ideally, write only enough test
code to fail, then write only enough production code to make the tests
pass.  Iterate as needed.[1]

Thanks in advance,
John
